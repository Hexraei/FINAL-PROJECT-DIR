 *(Note: It's highly recommended you take screenshots of your actual application and replace these placeholder image links.)*

#### Viewing, Editing, and Deleting Entries

The **"Recent Entries"** table shows all submitted data.

### 7. For All Users: The Reports Page

This page provides a comprehensive view of all data in the system. Officials can access this page by clicking the "View Reports" button from their dashboard. General Users are taken here directly after logging in.

#### Filtering Reports

At the top of the page, you can filter the data shown in the charts and table.

-   **Product:** Select a specific product from the dropdown to see only its data.
-   **Start Date / End Date:** Select a date range to view records from a specific period.
-   Click the **"Filter"** button to apply your selections.
-   Click the **"Reset"** button to clear all filters and view all data.

#### Viewing Charts and Data Tables

-   **Charts:** The Pie and Bar charts provide a visual summary of the total quantity for each product based on your current filters.
-   **Data Table:** The table at the bottom shows the detailed records matching your filters. It includes the product name, quantity, date, and who submitted it. If a record has been modified, you can click the **"View (X)"** button to see a detailed history of all changes, including what was changed, by whom, and when.



#### Exporting Data to Excel

You can download a report of the currently filtered data as a professional Excel (`.xlsx`) file.

1.  Apply any filters you need (by product or date range).
2.  Click the green **"Export"** button.
3.  Your browser will download an Excel file containing all the data currently visible in the data table.

### 8. For Administrators: Product Management (Backdoor)

This is a special administrative feature for managing the master list of products that appear in the data entry dropdown. This ensures consistency in product naming.

#### Accessing the Product Management Page

Only Officials can access this page, and only by using a special password.

1.  Go to the main **Login** page.
2.  Enter the email address of a registered **Official** user.

#### Adding and Deleting Master Products

-   **Add a Product:** In the "Add New Master Product" form, type the official name of a new product and click **"Add Product"**. It will now be available for selection on the data entry page.
-   **Delete a Product:** In the "Existing Master Products" list, click the red **"Ã—"** button next to a product name.
    -   A confirmation prompt will appear, requiring you to type the full product name to confirm the deletion. This is a safety measure to prevent accidental deletions.
    -   **Note:** You cannot delete a product that has already been used in a data entry report. This is to maintain data integrity.
